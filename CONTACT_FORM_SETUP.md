# Contact Form & Automated Email Setup - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Contact Form Processing**
- ✅ Contact form now submits to Django backend
- ✅ Form data is validated and saved to database
- ✅ Success message displayed after submission
- ✅ All form fields properly styled with Tailwind CSS

### 2. **Automated Email System (Option A)**
When a client submits the contact form:

**Client Receives:**
- ✅ Confirmation email with professional branding
- ✅ All 3 PDF documents automatically attached:
  - Intake & Scope Template
  - Service Agreement
  - Standard Operating Procedures
- ✅ Clear next steps and timeline

**Your Team Receives:**
- ✅ Internal notification email with submission details
- ✅ Client's message, service interest, and budget
- ✅ Timestamp of submission

### 3. **Database & Admin Panel**
- ✅ `ContactSubmission` model created
- ✅ All submissions saved in Django admin
- ✅ Admin interface to view, search, and filter submissions
- ✅ Access at: `/admin/main_app/contactsubmission/`

### 4. **Document Storage**
- ✅ Folder structure created:
  ```
  main_app/static/documents/
  ├── contracts/
  │   └── service_agreement.pdf
  ├── intake_scope/
  │   └── intake_and_scope_template.pdf
  └── sop/
      └── standard_operating_procedures.pdf
  ```

## 📋 Next Steps - What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add Your PDF Documents
1. Create or export your 3 PDF templates:
   - Service Agreement/Contract
   - Intake & Scope Form
   - Standard Operating Procedures

2. Place them in the correct folders:
   - `main_app/static/documents/contracts/service_agreement.pdf`
   - `main_app/static/documents/intake_scope/intake_and_scope_template.pdf`
   - `main_app/static/documents/sop/standard_operating_procedures.pdf`

### Step 2: Configure Email for Production
Currently set to console backend (development). For production:

**Option A: Gmail (Easiest)**
```python
# In config/settings.py
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'  # Use app-specific password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'inquire@dtbsolutions.tech'
CONTACT_EMAIL = 'inquire@dtbsolutions.tech'
```

**Option B: SendGrid (Recommended for Production)**
```bash
pip install sendgrid-django
```
Then configure in settings.py

**Option C: AWS SES**
```bash
pip install django-ses
```

### Step 3: Update Contact Email
In `config/settings.py`, set `CONTACT_EMAIL` to where you want internal notifications sent.

### Step 4: Test the Form
1. Go to `/contact` on your local server
2. Fill out and submit the form
3. Check console output for email content (development)
4. Verify submission appears in `/admin/main_app/contactsubmission/`
